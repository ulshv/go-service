# `go-service` is:

- Modular backend service written in Golang (mostly `stdlib`, but with some deps for SQL DBs).
- Includes User auth (register/login/authorization)
- Some simple domain-specific functionality as an example (implementation of online store or a marketplace)
- Can be started without external running deps (i.e. Postgres), SQLite can be used instead
- Headless backend, no GUI (maybe will be added in the future for as a reference implementation)
- [WIP] Full tests coverage (unit/e2e)
- [TODO] OpenAPI / Swagger
