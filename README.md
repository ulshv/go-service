# Online Store App

Simple implementation of a basic online store app,
implemented in Golang stdlib (backend) and React/Next.js (frontend).

# Why?

The goal of this project is to provide a simple (KISS) but complete
implementation of an online store to showcase my programming style
with Go (stdlib) and JS (React) to my future employers.

I'll try to keep the code both clean and simple, for the reviewers
of the source, as well as for developers who'd like to bootstrap
their online store based on this implementation.
